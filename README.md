# **Project 2 of Information Visualization**
Hello professor! You might already noticed that there aren't many commits. </br>

That's beacuse unfortunately, *GitHub* doesn't support version control for binary files like *PowerPoint* slides, so we used *Office 365* instead of this, and this repo could only be used for **file submission** :(. </br>

We are sorry about this.
